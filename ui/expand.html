    <p><a href="https://github.com/markedjs/marked/">Marked</a> lets you convert <a
            href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a> into HTML. Markdown is a simple text format
        whose goal is to be very easy to read and write, even when not converted to HTML. This demo page will let you
        type anything you like and see how it gets converted. Live. No more waiting around.</p>

    <h2 id="why-markdown">Why Markdown?</h2>
    <p>It's easy. It's not overly bloated, unlike HTML. Also, as the creator of <a
            href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">markdown</a> says,</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>The overriding design goal for Markdown's
            formatting syntax is to make it as readable
            as possible. The idea is that a
            Markdown-formatted document should be
            publishable as-is, as plain text, without
            looking like it's been marked up with tags
            or formatting instructions.</p>
